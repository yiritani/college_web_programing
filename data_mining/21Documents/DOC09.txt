What Is Biotechnology?
Biotechnology is a science-driven industry sector that uses living organisms and molecular biology to produce healthcare-related products. Biotechnology companies also develop therapeutics or processes (such as DNA fingerprinting). Biotechnology is best known for its role in medicine and pharmaceuticals, but the science is also applied in other areas such as genomics, food production, and the production of biofuels.

Biotechnology is the branch of applied science that uses living organisms and their derivatives to produce products and processes.
These products and processes feature in healthcare, medicine, biofuels, and environmental safety.
Biotech stocks are risky investments since biotech firms often spend massive amounts of time and money developing drugs that might never get to the market.
The top U.S.-based biotechnology firms in terms of market capitalization are Johnson & Johnson ($457.2 billion), Roche ($346.3 billion), Pfizer ($262.2 billion), and Novartis ($205 billion)â€”as of Sept. 1, 2021.
A valuation of a biotech firm should consider the size and development stage of the asset pipeline.
